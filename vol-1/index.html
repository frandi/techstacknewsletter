                            <h2 class="mb-5">Go Wandering: Cost Saving With Redis Cache</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p class="mb-3">
                            Redis is known as a distributed cache tool to improve data access performance. 
                            But, it is interesting to see that the Go Wandering team also found another benefit of using it to save operational costs. 
                            How?
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-3">
                            Just like any other modern SaaS (Software as a Service) nowadays, the Go Wandering system is orchestrated to work with many external services to do various things. 
                            For example, it requires service to get weather conditions or get nearby facilities around certain places.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-3">
                            Depending on the subscription plan, these external services usually have a specific access policy limiting the number of API requests on a particular period or accepts any calls and increases the bills if it's a "pay as you go" plan. 
                            In both cases, having a strategy to minimize the calls to the external services will positively impact the performance and the expense. 
                            The team then sees that Redis cache could be a solution for this.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-3">
                            Interestingly, the Go Wandering team did not choose the caching strategy for cost-saving purposes at first. 
                            They used it to decrease the database load, which will boost the application's performance in general.
                        </p>

                            <p>
                                "We needed a caching strategy to improve performance. We're already familiar with Redis, so it was evident that it became our first option. 
                                And we didn't have to worry about managing the infrastructure because there was this Azure Cache for Redis that we can use. 
                                It fitted with our general infrastructure set up in Azure.", said Brain Balaka, the Director of Product, Polyrific.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="mb-3">
                            Delegating some data access traffic to Redis cache means that they didn't have to worry about scaling up the database size radically when the application's load increases. 
                            Furthermore, having additional caching infrastructure is much cheaper than scaling up the database specs in general. 
                            So the team saw that the caching strategy also had a good impact on the costs.
                        </p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">
                            <p>
                                "We immediately noticed that the usage of Redis cache effectively decreased the need to connect to the database. 
                                If it works with the internal data source, we think it will work with the external data sources as well.", Brain continued.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="mb-3">
                            Implementing Redis as a cache strategy for the external services was a smart move. 
                            It minimized the need to call the external APIs, which positively impacted the overall performance and the expense.
                        </p>

                                "Yes, that's right, it also cut the cost!" Brain confirmed with his smiley face.

                            The saving was varied, depending on the characteristics of the cached data. 
                            Some data can be cached for a longer time, like the events data in a particular area. 
                            But, some data needs to be refreshed more often, like the information on current weather. 
                            The team still needs to define the best caching policy for each of them. 
                            But overall, it's a massive win for the operation of the application.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-3">
                            Caching strategy is not the only thing done by the Go Wandering team to save the expense. 
                            We will learn more about the other exciting methods on different occasions in the future.
